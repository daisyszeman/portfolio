                <p>There is a sixth sense called proprioception in addition to the familiar five senses, which is the sense of where our body is in space that allows us to move in space, knowing our position in space without actually seeing it. This project is inspired by the sense of proprioception, how we feel our body in space and move, to record the trail of our movement and visualise it. Also we are sensitive to sound, we react to the sound naturally, while mostly we play a passive role in hearing the sound, I tried to make it the other way round, which sound is controlled by our movement, we become an active role in controlling the sound and move according to what we heard.</p>
